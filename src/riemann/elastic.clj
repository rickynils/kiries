  event.

  The :index argument defaults to \"logstash\" for Kibana
  compatability.  It's the root ES index name that this event will be
  indexed within.
  
  The :timestamping argument, default to :day and it controls the time
  range component of the index name.  Acceptable values
  are :hour, :day, :week, :month and :year.

  Events will be massages to conform to Kubana expections.  This means
  that the `@timestamp` field will be set if not found, based on the
  `time` field of the event.  The `ttl` field will be removed, as it's
  internal to Riemann.  Lastly, any fields starting with an `_` will
  have their value parsed as EDN.
